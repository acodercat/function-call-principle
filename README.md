## About This Guide

This visual guide explains how function calls work at the low level, using detailed diagrams to illustrate the complete stack evolution during function execution. Through hands-on examples on the x86-64 platform, you'll gain a solid understanding of how C code translates to assembly instructions. The guide concludes with practical examples demonstrating interesting stack frame behaviors.

### What You Will Learn

- How control transfers between functions
- How data is passed between functions
- How stack frames are created and destroyed
- The dangers of array out-of-bounds access in C/C++
- Why inline functions are more efficient
- Why loops are preferred over recursion
- Why static variables persist after function returns
- What stack overflow attacks are and how they work
